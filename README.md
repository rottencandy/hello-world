# hello-world

Hello there!!!

  As you can see, im following the github tutorial to create this repo.
  Im a teen programmer who is currently guessing what to write in this file.
  I like tacos too and hope to someday make a journey to the moon.
  So this line was created in the third edit and im still guessing what to write.
